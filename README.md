# ðŸŽ¬ Content-Based Movie Recommender System (NumPy + Pandas)

A fully interpretable, content-based movie recommender system built **from scratch** using only **NumPy** and **Pandas**. This project demonstrates how to engineer movie similarity using textual metadata from the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), without relying on external machine learning libraries.

ðŸ“– Overview

This system recommends similar movies by analyzing:
- Genre tags
- Plot keywords
- Overview and tagline descriptions
- Top-billed cast
- Director
